## ðŸ“– Overview

The **Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF)** problem asks:  

> *Given multiple agents with individual start and goal positions on a grid, find collision-free paths that minimize the total cost.*  

ICTS addresses this with a **two-level search framework**:

- **High-Level Search (ICT):** Expands nodes representing combinations of agent path costs.  
- **Low-Level Search (MDD-based):** Builds **Multi-valued Decision Diagrams (MDDs)** to check if valid, conflict-free paths exist.  

This implementation also includes **Simple Pairwise Pruning** and **Enhanced Pairwise Pruning** optimizations.
